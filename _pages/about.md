Hello, and welcome!

I am a first-year master student in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at the Beihang University (BUAA), advised by [Prof. Shan Zhang](https://shi.buaa.edu.cn/zhangshan/zh_CN/index.htm).

Prior to Beihang University, I received my B.S. from Nankai University in 2024.

## Research interests

I'm broadly interested in topics related to computer network, distributed system and security.
